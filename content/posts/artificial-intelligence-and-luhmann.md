tldr: The german philosopher Niklas Luhmann is famous for his system theory which models the world as a set of black box items that interact with one another. This mental model fits in the modern world of artificial intelligence (AI) where systems facilities complex models based on artificial neural networks (and similar approaches) that are black boxes to other components. In this article I discuss how this concept can help to explain AI and might be useful to build guidelines and regulations.
