This project is started to be a mix of a personal blog, a set of random thoughts and a collection of unfinished/in-progress research. I see it as the public version of my personal notebook. I try my best to underlay my thoughts with references and provide further readings for the interested reader. Nevertheless, some of the pieces found here are just quick write ups of whatever is on my mind - so be easy on me.

Due to my daily work and my vita, my main interests are in the area of information systems, complex and data-intensive software as well as other technology related topics. However, sometimes I try to connect the dots to other domains such as philosophical aspects, politics and many more.

You are welcome to browser around. If you want to discuss certain topics, please feel welcome to contact me
at [discuss@explore-thinking.com](mailto:discuss@explore-thinking.com) - but please be kind human being - even if you have other views :).

# About me

My name is Julian. I'm a co-founder of some technology related companies where we combine modern web approaches with the power of data to help organizations to solve actual real-world problems. In my day-to-day work I talk to customers to understand their needs, design adequate technology architectures and support my team wherever I can.
Moreover, I'm a passionate researcher in the area of information systems. I published international research papers about business intelligence and analytics with a focus on how efficient analytics landscapes can be designed in today's complex business world with decentralized and heterogeneous data sources. 
Currently, I continue my research outside of academia and share my knowledge in blog articles and as a speaker on conferences and local meetups.

Besides these professional aspects, I'm interested in many not (directly) technology related topics, such as philosophy, psychology, medicine and many more. I like to meet new people and learn about their perspectives. So feel free to get in touch with me at any time.
